# STRV Similarity Search: System Architecture and Implementation

This document provides a detailed overview of the STRV Similarity Search system architecture, implementation details, and design decisions.

## System Overview

STRV Similarity Search is an image similarity search platform that consists of multiple integrated components:

1. **Feature Extraction Engine**: Processes images to extract semantic feature vectors
2. **FastAPI Backend**: Provides a RESTful API for search and data retrieval 
3. **Streamlit Frontend**: Offers a user-friendly web interface
4. **Vector Database**: Stores and indexes feature vectors for efficient search
5. **Logging System**: Provides comprehensive monitoring and debugging capabilities

## Component Details

### 1. Feature Extraction Engine

The feature extraction engine is built around a ResNet50 CNN model pretrained on ImageNet:

#### Key Implementation Features:
- **Model Architecture**: Uses ResNet50 with the classification layer removed
- **Multi-backend Support**: 
  - CUDA acceleration for NVIDIA GPUs
  - MPS acceleration for Apple Silicon
  - CPU fallback for universal compatibility
- **Batch Processing**: Optimized for efficient processing of large image sets
- **Normalization**: Feature vectors are L2-normalized for consistent similarity measurement
- **Error Handling**: Robust handling of corrupted or unsupported images

#### Processing Pipeline:
1. Image loading and resizing to 224x224 pixels
2. Normalization using ImageNet mean/std values
3. Forward pass through the ResNet50 model
4. Feature extraction from the penultimate layer (2048 dimensions)
5. L2 normalization of feature vectors

### 2. FastAPI Backend

The backend API is implemented using FastAPI with several key optimizations:

#### Endpoints:
- `/health`: System health status and diagnostics
- `/search/image`: Image upload and similarity search
- `/stats`: Dataset statistics and system information

#### Key Implementation Features:
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Non-blocking request handling
- **Background Initialization**: System initializes in the background while reporting status
- **Path Validation**: Robust path resolution across different deployment environments
- **Middleware**: Request logging and error tracking
- **CORS Support**: Cross-origin request support for integration with web applications

#### Search Implementation:
Two search methods are supported:
1. **FAISS-based Search**: 
   - Used when FAISS is available
   - Provides sub-linear time complexity for large datasets
   - Supports exact (flat index) and approximate methods
   
2. **Optimized Brute Force Search**:
   - Fallback when FAISS is unavailable
   - Uses batched processing to manage memory
   - Employs min-heap for efficient top-k tracking
   - Optimized vector operations with NumPy

### 3. Streamlit Frontend

The frontend is built with Streamlit and offers a rich user experience:

#### Key Features:
- **User Authentication**: Simple username/password login
- **Image Upload**: Drag-and-drop or file browser upload
- **Image Filters**: Real-time image filtering options

- **Saved Items**: User can save and retrieve favorite images
- **Personalized Feed**: Content recommendations based on user interactions

#### Implementation Details:
- **State Management**: Session state for tracking user preferences
- **Component Layout**: Responsive design with tabs and columns
- **Image Processing**: Client-side image filtering with PIL
- **Interactive Elements**: Buttons and cards for user interaction
- **Caching**: Strategic caching for improved performance

### 4. Vector Database

The vector database is implemented using HDF5 files with an optional FAISS index:

#### Structure:
- **Features Dataset**: 2D array of feature vectors (n_images × 2048)
- **Paths Dataset**: Array of image file paths
- **Metadata**: Information about the feature extraction process

#### Implementation Details:
- **Chunked Storage**: Efficient access to subsets of the data
- **Compression**: Light gzip compression for reduced storage requirements
- **Appending Support**: New images can be added without reprocessing the entire dataset
- **Path Caching**: In-memory cache of image paths for faster retrieval

### 5. Logging System

A comprehensive logging system is implemented for monitoring and debugging:

#### Key Features:
- **Structured JSON Logging**: Machine-readable log format
- **Console Output**: Color-coded logs for development
- **File Rotation**: Automatic log file rotation to manage disk usage
- **Error Tracking**: Separate error log file
- **Performance Metrics**: Timing and resource usage logs
- **Request Tracking**: Unique IDs for request tracing

#### Log Levels:
- **DEBUG**: Detailed information for development
- **INFO**: General operational information
- **WARNING**: Potential issues that don't prevent operation
- **ERROR**: Errors that prevent specific operations
- **CRITICAL**: System-wide failures

## Data Flow

### Image Processing Flow:
1. **Image Collection**: Images are collected from source directories
2. **Feature Extraction**: The feature extractor processes images in batches
3. **Database Storage**: Features and paths are stored in the H5 file
4. **Optional Indexing**: FAISS index is built for optimized search

### Search Flow:
1. **User Upload**: User uploads an image through the frontend
2. **Feature Extraction**: The uploaded image is processed to extract features
3. **Similarity Search**: Features are compared against the database
4. **Results Retrieval**: Top-k similar images are identified
5. **Path Resolution**: Image paths are validated and resolved
6. **Response Formation**: Results are formatted and returned to the frontend
7. **Display**: Frontend displays the results in a grid layout

## Error Handling and Recovery

The system implements comprehensive error handling:

### Backend Error Handling:
- **Input Validation**: Validates file types and request parameters
- **Process Isolation**: Feature extraction errors don't crash the system
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Multiple search methods available
- **Path Resolution**: Multiple approaches to resolve valid paths
- **Request Timeout**: Long-running operations are monitored

### Frontend Error Handling:
- **Connection Issues**: Graceful handling of API unavailability
- **Image Display**: Fallbacks for missing or corrupt images
- **State Management**: Robust session state handling
- **User Feedback**: Clear error messages for users

## Scaling Considerations

The system is designed with scaling in mind:

### Vertical Scaling:
- **Memory Optimization**: Efficient use of available memory
- **Batch Processing**: Adjustable batch sizes based on resources
